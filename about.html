				<div class="description"> 
					Since 1976, Cal's Pilipino American Alliance has upheld the yearly tradition of presenting PCN to the greater community. Pilipino Cultural Night consists of a one-day, three-hour theatrical production followed by a dinner open to the whole community. In it's 38th year, PCN's theatrical performance will be a full-fledged musical. The musical will consist of one main storyline that fu dlly integrates musical performances, ranging from choral ensembles to solos & duets and dance performances, ranging from traditional/folk style to jazz & modern, with music scores played by our live band. In addition, throughout the show, artistic work can be seen on the backdrops and stage techniques. The show does not only highlight the artistic creativity of our directors and the talent that our cast members have, but it also sheds light on issues and experiences of our common heritage and culture. The different themes and ideas we address handle issues such as identity, history, and political movement.

				<div class="title">PCN History</div>
				<div class="description"> 
					 UC Berkeley's PCN started in 1976 at the YWCA on Bancroft and Bowditch. The original show was a community dinner and traditional/folk dances with a cast of about 10-15 members, In the 1980s, the show evolved into a full-scale performance, and by 1989, the Pilipino American Alliance became the first student group on campus to hold a performance in Zellerbach Hall. Since then, we have continuted to foster an annual production in Zellerbach Hall. As the longest running cultural show on the UC Berkeley campus, we are humbled and honored by every single year that has come before us. PCN has been an avenue for creativity, innovation, and artistic expression in the community ever since its initial conception. What you see on the Zellerbach stage is the product of dedication, teamwork, and love from each and every individual. UC Berkeley's PCN is truly a testament to the dynamics of power, creation, and art behind Pilipin@ American students.

				<div class="title">PAA History</div>
				<div class="description"> 
					 In 1969, in the midst of a turbulent era of protest and struggle, Pilipino students rallied together to create an organization to advance political, economic, and social justice. This group was called the Pilipino American Alliance (PAA), initiated by its founders to protect and enhance the representation of Pilipinos and Pilipino Americans on the Berkeley campus and the surrounding community. During its 45-year existence, PAA has strived to promote a network of social support for the Pilipino and Pilipino-American community through the encouragement of political struggle, academic excellence, and cultural awareness while encouraging unity on campus through the celebration of cultural diversity. PAA is the longest running Pilipino organization on the UC Berkeley campus.
